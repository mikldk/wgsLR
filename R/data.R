#' Marker candidates (v1)
#' 
#' Data from The Genome Aggregation Database (gnomAD) for 
#' binary SNP loci with `rs` names, i.e., 
#' where the `rs` column starts with `rs`, 
#' there is one character in the `ref` column and one character in the `alt` column.
#' 
#' The loci are filtered by MAF values for AFR, EAS, and NFE populations. 
#' The MAF values must be within 0.1, 0.15, 0.2 from 0.5.
